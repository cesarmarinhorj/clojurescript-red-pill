#Terms

##Object Oriented Language

Having a class keyword doesn't make a
language object oriented, it makes it class oriented.

A class a factory method for generating objects.

##Simple vs Easy

Easy is a synonym for familiar, "within reach". Simple is measurable.

- Does it have dependencies?
- Does it have long running state?
- Does it cause side effects (implicit or explicit)?
- Is there Cognitive Friction?

##Hard vs Complex

Hard is a synonym for unfamiliar, "distant".

- Things that are Hard can (eventually) become Easy.
- Things that are Complex can't become Simple.
- To make something Complex as a verb: Complect.
